1. The task is to create a page dedicated to a person, place, or thing. My choice was for Nintendo consoles, due to the inspiration and influence they have had on my life.
2. For the HTML, the task asks to use basic syntax with main and footer sections, as well as, an unordered list. Doing so, with the amount of images and separation, meant I had to specific many different areas with divs and certain elements.
3. The CSS was a fun task. My plan was to separate the information in a manner that was easy to read for the user and also fun. I achieved this by following Nintendo's Joy Con colours and included margins and padding for structured data. The whole page is responsive and works on many screen sizes.
